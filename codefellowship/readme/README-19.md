* Ability for logged in users to create posts
* Ability to see all posts made by users they follow (via a route like /feed)
* Ability to follow a user (via a /users/{id} route)

## Resources
* [Spring Auth Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-java-401d2/blob/master/SpringAuthCheatSheet.md)

## Stretch Goals
* Add a notifications system to CodeFellowship. Display a notification to users when people comment on their posts.
*  Using WebSockets, make that notifications system show updates in real time, not just when the page refreshes.
*  Using WebSockets, implement a messaging feature on CodeFellowship.
